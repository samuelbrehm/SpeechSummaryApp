# PRP: Core ML Text Summarization Implementation

## Product Requirements Prompt

### Context
Following the inability to use FoundationModels for text summarization, we need to implement a 100% on-device text summarization solution using Core ML with a local model. This maintains our privacy-first approach while providing intelligent summarization capabilities.

### User Story
As a user, I want to convert speech to text and then get an intelligent summary of the transcribed content, all processed locally on my device to ensure complete privacy.

### Feature Requirements

#### Functional Requirements
1. **Core ML Model Integration**
   - Load and initialize a local summarization model (e.g., DistilBART, T5-small)
   - Handle model loading states and error conditions
   - Optimize model performance for mobile devices

2. **Text Summarization Service**
   - Process transcribed text through the Core ML model
   - Support configurable summary length (short, medium, long)
   - Handle text preprocessing and postprocessing
   - Provide real-time summarization feedback

3. **User Interface**
   - Display summarization progress with liquid glass effects
   - Show original transcription and generated summary side-by-side
   - Allow users to adjust summary parameters
   - Export summarized content functionality

4. **Error Handling**
   - Model loading failures
   - Insufficient device resources
   - Text length limitations
   - Network-free operation validation

#### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**
   - Model loading time < 3 seconds
   - Summarization processing time < 5 seconds for typical text
   - Memory usage optimization for mobile devices

2. **Privacy**
   - 100% on-device processing
   - No network requests for summarization
   - No data persistence beyond user preferences

3. **Compatibility**
   - iOS 15.0+ (Core ML minimum requirement)
   - iPhone 12+ recommended for optimal performance
   - iPad support with enhanced UI

### Technical Constraints

#### Model Selection Criteria
- **Size**: Maximum 50MB for reasonable app size
- **Format**: Core ML (.mlmodel) compatible
- **Input**: Plain text processing capability
- **Output**: Coherent summary generation
- **Performance**: Optimized for Apple Neural Engine

#### Recommended Models
1. **DistilBART-CNN-12-6** - Balanced performance/size
2. **T5-small** - Good generalization capabilities  
3. **PEGASUS-xsum** - Abstractive summarization focus

### Implementation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Core ML Integration
- Research and select appropriate summarization model
- Convert model to Core ML format if necessary
- Implement SummarizationService with Core ML backend
- Create basic model loading and inference pipeline

#### Phase 2: Service Layer Development
- Implement SummarizationUseCase business logic
- Add text preprocessing and validation
- Handle model output parsing and formatting
- Integrate with existing SpeechService workflow

#### Phase 3: UI/UX Implementation
- Design summarization results interface
- Add progress indicators and loading states
- Implement summary parameter controls
- Create export and sharing functionality

#### Phase 4: Optimization & Testing
- Performance optimization for various devices
- Memory usage optimization
- Unit testing for service layer
- Integration testing with speech recognition flow

### Acceptance Criteria

#### Must Have

- [ ] Process transcribed text and generate coherent summaries
- [ ] Display summarization results in clean, readable format
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Maintain 100% on-device processing

#### Should Have
- [ ] Configurable summary length options
- [ ] Real-time summarization progress feedback
- [ ] Export functionality for summaries
- [ ] Performance optimization for older devices

#### Could Have
- [ ] Multiple summarization models to choose from
- [ ] Summary quality indicators
- [ ] Batch processing for multiple transcriptions
- [ ] Summary comparison features

### Dependencies
- Core ML framework
- Natural Language framework for text preprocessing
- Existing SpeechService integration
- SwiftUI for enhanced user interface

### Risks and Mitigations

#### Technical Risks
- **Model size vs performance trade-off**
  - Mitigation: Benchmark multiple models, implement lazy loading
- **Device compatibility limitations**
  - Mitigation: Feature availability checks, graceful degradation
- **Memory constraints on older devices**
  - Mitigation: Memory monitoring, batch processing optimization

#### User Experience Risks
- **Long processing times**
  - Mitigation: Progress indicators, background processing
- **Summary quality inconsistency**
  - Mitigation: Model validation, fallback strategies

### Success Metrics
- Model loading success rate > 95%
- Average summarization time < 5 seconds
- User satisfaction with summary quality > 4.0/5.0
- Zero network requests for summarization feature
- Memory usage within iOS app limits

### Future Considerations
- Integration with future iOS AI frameworks
- Model updates and versioning strategy
- Advanced summarization techniques (multi-document, domain-specific)
- Voice-to-summary direct pipeline optimization
